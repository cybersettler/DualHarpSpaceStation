# Dual Harp Space Station

An open source / open hardware project for a space station. The basic concept consist of two single pylon cable-stayed harp bridges connected by their pylons with a cable.

## Dimensions

The approximate dimensions of the station are:

* Radius: ~1000 m
* Bridge span: 300 - 500 m
* Width: 30 - 50 m
* Pylon height: ~200 m

## Rotation

The Station would rotate approximately at 1.5 rpm to achieve a centrifugal acceleration of 1 g.

## Bridge design

The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable-stayed_bridge] cable-stayed bridge design is based on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Bridge] Ada Bridge in Serbia.

## Materials

While the Ada Bridge main construction material are concrete and steel, the Space Station would replace steel with kevlar or other light material.
